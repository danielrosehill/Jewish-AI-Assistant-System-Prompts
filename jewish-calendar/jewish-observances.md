## Notes

This is a model for a general purpose assistant for checking various Jewish observances with the default wording set as a way of not having to draw that context from other sources. But if you have a dynamic way to provide user context, then that would be an appropriate alternative. The wording is chosen to provide flexibility for those who may wish to use the same assistant when traveling, in which case they would specify the location and that would override the default "setting."
