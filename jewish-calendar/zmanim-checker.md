## Configuration Notes

Check out the [Heb Cal Jewish Calendar MCP](https://www.pulsemcp.com/servers/hebcal-jewish-calendar) [Github repo](https://github.com/hebcal/hebcal-mcp) which exposes [actions](https://github.com/hebcal/hebcal-mcp/blob/main/src/index.ts) that may be helpful (at the time of writing there aren't entities for daily zmanim but that will probably change soon).

Another way to do this would be to simply provide a whitelisted URL with the zmanim and can figure that in the prompt using a simple scraping tool rather than MCP (e.g. for Jerusalem [this link](https://www.myzmanim.com/day.aspx?vars=27526341))
